# INSTRUCTIONS FOR DIABETES APP

1. ## Introduction:
   - This app helps users monitor and predict their diabetes risk by inputting key health data.
   - The app uses a machine learning model to predict whether the user is at risk for diabetes based on factors like glucose levels, BMI, age, and more.

2. ## Prerequisites:
   - Tools and software required:
     
     - Flutter 3.x or higher (for mobile app development)
       
     - Dart (for Flutter)
       
     - FastAPI or another backend framework (for handling predictions)
       
     - Python 3.x (for backend)
       
     - SQLite / PostgreSQL (for storing data, if necessary)
       
     - Any other libraries or tools

3. ## Installation:
   - Follow these steps to set up the app:
     
     a. Clone the repository: `git clone [[repository link](https://github.com/Justice00000/linear_regression_model)]`
   
     b. Install Flutter by following the setup instructions on Flutter's official website: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
     
     c. Install the required dependencies for the backend: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
     
     d. I already configured FASTAPI for it.

5. ## Running the Program:
     a. Open the Flutter project.
   
     b. Run the mobile app with: `flutter run`
   
     c. Test the app on an emulator or real device to ensure it works as expected.

7. ## Using the App:
   - Open the app on your device/emulator.
     
   - Enter your health data (pregnancies, glucose levels, BMI, etc.) into the provided fields.
     
   - Press the "Predict" button to submit the data to the backend for analysis.
     
   - View your prediction result displayed on the screen.

8. ## Testing:
     a. Test all user inputs to ensure they are correctly sent to the backend.
   
     b. Validate that the correct prediction result is displayed to the user.

10. ## Troubleshooting:
   - Common issues and solutions:
     - If you get a "500 Internal Server Error" from the backend, check the server logs for more details on what went wrong.
     - If the mobile app doesnâ€™t show predictions, ensure the backend is running and accessible.
     - If you encounter an issue with database connections, verify the database credentials and URL.
     - Ensure all Flutter dependencies are installed and up to date by running `flutter pub get`.
